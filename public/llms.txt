## Architecture

```
Browser (Angular App)
    ↓
Google Calendar API (HTTPS)
    ↓
Cloud Run Container
    ├── nginx (serves static files)
    └── Angular production build
```

- No backend service required
- API key exposed in browser (acceptable for public calendar)
- nginx configured for SPA routing (fallback to index.html)
- Cloud Run scales to zero when idle
- Multi-stage Docker build for optimized images

## Development

The project uses modern Angular tooling:

- **Package Manager**: npm
- **Dev Server**: Angular CLI (localhost:4200)
- **Build Tool**: Angular CLI with production optimizations
- **Containerization**: Docker with multi-stage builds
- **Testing**: Karma with Jasmine
